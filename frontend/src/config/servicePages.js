  {
    question: 'How much does custom software development cost?',
    answer:
      'Project costs depend on scope, complexity, integrations, and timeline. A focused MVP may start from a smaller budget, while enterprise platforms with multiple modules require a larger investment. GlobalItSync provides transparent estimates after a discovery call, breaking down design, development, testing, and deployment so you understand exactly what you are paying for.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does development take?',
    answer:
      'Timelines vary by project size. A marketing website or simple web app may take four to eight weeks, while a full custom software platform can take three to six months or longer. We work in agile sprints with regular demos, so you see progress early and can adjust priorities without derailing the schedule.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide AWS deployment?',
    answer:
      'Yes. GlobalItSync designs, builds, and deploys applications on AWS using services such as EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, and CloudFront. We configure CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and security best practices so your application is production-ready, scalable, and cost-efficient from day one.',

    question: 'Do you offer post-launch support?',
