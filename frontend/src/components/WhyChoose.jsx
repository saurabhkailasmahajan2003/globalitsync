    question: 'Why should I choose GlobalItSync over other development teams?',
    answer:
      'We combine hands-on engineering with real business understanding—not just ticket closing. Every project gets senior oversight, clean architecture, and a team that treats your goals as their own.',

    question: 'Do you have an experienced in-house team?',
    answer:
      'Yes. GlobalItSync is built around a dedicated in-house team of developers, designers, and AI engineers. You work directly with the people building your product, not a revolving door of freelancers.',

    question: 'How do you keep projects on track and on time?',

      'We work in agile two-week sprints with regular demos, clear milestones, and transparent communication. You see working progress early, give feedback often, and stay informed at every stage.',

  {
    question: 'Will the software scale as my business grows?',
    answer:
      'Scalability is built in from day one. We design systems that handle growth—from hundreds of users to thousands—using modern stacks, cloud-ready infrastructure, and maintainable code.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide support after launch?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. We offer post-launch maintenance, bug fixes, security updates, and feature enhancements. Many clients stay with us long-term because we know their systems inside out.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How transparent is your development process?',
    answer:
      'Full transparency. You get sprint updates, access to progress demos, honest timelines, and clear estimates. No hidden costs, no black-box development—we partner with you openly.',
